  * Secure password verification using hashed passwords
    
  * JWT token generation after successful login
    
  * Session management to maintain login state
    
## Sign Up Process
  
  * OTP-based email verification
    
  * Multi-step registration flow:
    i. User fills registration form (name, email, password)
    
    ii. System checks for existing email
    
    iii. OTP is generated and sent via email
    
    iv. User enters OTP for verification
    
    v. Account is created after successful verification
    
* Database Architecture
  
## SQLite Database Setup

* Database File: users.db
  
* Lightweight and efficient storage system
  
## 📋 Users Table Schema

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (

    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    
    name TEXT NOT NULL,

    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    
);

## 🔒 Security Features

* 🔐 Password hashing using Werkzeug (generate_password_hash)
  
* ✅ Secure password verification (check_password_hash)
  
* 🚫 Unique email constraint to prevent duplicates
